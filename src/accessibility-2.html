            <h1>Accessibility - part 2</h1>
            <p>In the previous part of this article I dove into accessibility of the web for deaf and blind people. In this
                article I continueau on this subject but this time I&#39;m researching the disabilities colorblindness and
                motor skill disorders.</p>
            <h2>Colorbind people</h2>
            <p>1 of 12 men are color blind. At women this is 1 of 250 (Astrid-d-g, 2016). This is an enourmous amount of people
                with a disabilitie. There are multiple types of color blindness:</p>

            <p>
                <strong>Normal sight</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src='img/normal.jpg' alt='normal' referrerPolicy='no-referrer' />
                <em>(Wikipedia, n.d.)</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Protanopia</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src='img/Protanopia.png' alt='Protanopia' referrerPolicy='no-referrer' />
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>(Wikipedia, n.d.)</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Deuteranopes</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src='img/Deuteranopes.jpg' alt='Deuteranopes' referrerPolicy='no-referrer' />
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>(Wikipedia, n.d.)</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Tritanopes</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src='img/Tritanopes.jpg' alt='Tritanopes' referrerPolicy='no-referrer' />
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>(Wikipedia, n.d.)</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Monochromacy</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src='img/Monochromacy.jpg' alt='Monochromacy' referrerPolicy='no-referrer' />
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>(Wikipedia, n.d.)</em>
            </p>
            <p>The biggest obstacle of being color blind in combination with the web is where states are only expressed using
                color. For example when the user choses a answer in a quiz and it highlights only in red or green. If there
                is no other indencation if the answer is right or wrong it will be very hard for the user to understand it.
                If the designer or developer only added an icon with for example a checkmark it would be much better. Also
                it&#39;s important to take into account the contrast of colors for people that suffer colorblindness.</p>

            <h2>People with poor motor skills</h2>
            <p>An other interesetting group of people are those with a motor skill disorder. They often can&#39;t control their
                hands or arms like &quot;normal&quot; people can do. So this makes it very hard to control their mouse. A
                lot of the web depends on users using their mouse as main input device. You might think about the tab key
                right now, but the fact is that many designers and developers don&#39;t style these and sometimes even remove
                them.
            </p>
            <p>Marijn, the person that I spoke about his disorder and using the web with it, mostly uses his spacebar to navigate
                trough websites. The spacebar scrolls the website for a large part to next viewport. If he wants to scroll
                only a bit he uses his arrow keys. Clicking on items he still did with his mouse.</p>
            <p>This is a way of navigating that he finds most quick. He doesn&#39;t even bother using the tab key anymore because
                of the lacking focus states. </p>
            <p>Also, by default, a lot elements can be dragged in a browser. For most people this isn&#39;t a problem and it
                can come in handy. However when your arm or hand moves a lot it might be hard to click on those elements.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The web is place where people with a disability shouldn&#39;t be limited. It was build with accessibility in
                mind. In reality this isn&#39;t the case and often it&#39;s still not a very good expierence to browse the
                web for these people. Developers and designers should be more aware about these users. A good tool to test
                your websites as if you has one of these disabilities is
                <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/funkify-disability-simula/ojcijjdchelkddboickefhnbdpeajdjg'>Funkify</a>. Funkify aims to simulate certain disorders and you can toggle it in Chrome. But keep in mind
                that you can turn it off at any time but those people can&#39;t.</p>
